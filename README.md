# ShadeMsg
Chat app in console 

ShadeMSG is a communicator written in c # without a graphical interface using cmd.
This project is mainly used to learn programming. From time to time I will introduce new updates.
If I manage to get the basic functionality I will consider writing a Xamarin mobile application client

ShadeHero
